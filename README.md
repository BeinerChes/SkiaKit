# SkiaKit

SkiaKit is a 2D Graphics Library for use with Swift.   It is powered by Google's
[Skia](https://skia.org) graphics library, the same library that powers Google Chrome 
and Android graphics.

The Swift bindings are intended to be cross-platform, both to Apple platforms, and
new platforms where Skia and Swift run.

This work uses extensive code from Microsoft's SkiaSharp bindings authoered by 
Matthew Leibowitz and dozens of contributors.   SkiaSharp just happens to have
a very advanced set of bridge APIs to the underlying Skia engine that does not 
existin in the upstream Google Skia project.
